  <div class="depthText"><h1>Prejudice</h1><p>In <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, prejudice takes many forms, including racial prejudice, class prejudice, and origin prejudice. None of the characters, even the "good" ones, are immune to prejudice. This website will go through different characters in <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, and examine their individual prejudices.</p></div>
  <div id="scout" class="imdo"><div class="caption"><span class="charCaption"></span></div></div>
  <div class="depthText"><h1>Scout</h1><p> Scout is the main character of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, and has her share of prejudices. A notable example happens early in the book when she asks Walter Cunningham why he was pouring so much syrup on his food. When Calpurnia reminds Scout that Walter is her company, Scout says “He ain’t company, Cal, he’s just a Cunningham.” This shows Scout’s belief that those of lower social classes might not deserve the same standards of politeness that she shows to someone like Mrs. Maudie. Another example of Scout’s prejudice, this time origin-based, comes when she is introduced to her new teacher, Ms. Caroline. Ms. Caroline introduced herself as being from Winston County, and Scout wondered if she would “prove to harbor her share of the peculiarities indigenous to that region.” Scout eventually gets into trouble with Ms. Caroline, and her suspicions about Ms. Caroline may not have helped her with her attitude when dealing with her new teacher. Scout is notably unprejudiced when it comes to race, a rare exception when it comes to residents of Maycomb. She treats black people just like anyone else, saying “I think there's just one kind of folks. Folks.” Although she doesn’t really seem to understand why that’s such a big deal.

  <div id="jem" class="imdo"><div class="caption"><span class="charCaption"></span></div></div>
  <div class="depthText"><h1>Jem</h1><p>Jem is Scout’s brother, and is one of the more unprejudiced characters in the book. One prejudice he does have, however, is one of gender. An example is when Scout is protesting his and Dill’s plan to look in the Radley house, and Jem says “Scout, I’ tellin’ you for the last time, shut your trap or go home - I declare to the Lord you’re gettin’ more like a girl every day!” This shows how Jem thinks girls are always scared and not good companions for adventures. This belief probably stems partly from Aunt Alexandra’s influence, as well as the cultural norms of the time. It’s unclear whether Jem sees people as girls and boys based on what activities they perform, or whether being like a girl was simply an effective threat against Scout, who doesn’t want to be a “proper” lady, like her aunt wants.

  <div class="depthText"><h1>Aunt Alexandra</h1><p>Aunt Alexandra is Scout’s aunt, and an excellent demonstration of sexism in Maycomb. She believes that Scout should not be acting the way she is (running around in overalls) and should be more of a proper lady, wearing dresses and doing ladylike activities. Scout describes the issue as “I could not possibly hope to be a lady if I wore breeches, when I said I could do nothing in a dress, she said I wasn’t supposed to be doing things that required pants.” This sums up Aunt Alexandra’s prejudices well, showing her traditional beliefs that women are supposed to wear women's clothing and perform sedentary activities. However, Aunt Alexandra is not without empathy - she helps Scout after Bob Ewell’s attack, and in her distraction even hands Scout a pair of overalls to put on.

  <div id="cunningham" class="imdo"><div class="caption"><span class="charCaption"></span></div></div>
  <div class="depthText"><h1>Mr. Cunningham</h1><p>Mr. Cunningham is one of the poorer people in Maycomb. His most notable appearance is as part of a mob trying to enter the county jail, where Tom Robinson is being held overnight. Mr. Cunningham’s prejudice against black people has helped him join a mob mentality, wanting to get into the jail. Luckily, Scout helps him break out by simply talking to him, unaware of what she is doing: “Don’t you remember me, Mr. Cunningham? I’m Jean Louise Finch.” This incident is important because later on in the story, when Mr. Cunningham serves on the jury deciding Tom’s fate, he argues for Tom at first, until he is eventually worn down by the other jurors. This shows how even though prejudices can be extremely dangerous, those holding them can still be made to see things in a better way.
</p></div>
  <div id="ewell" class="imdo"><div class="caption"><span class="charCaption"></span></div></div>
  <div class="depthText"><h1>Bob Ewell</h1><p>Bob Ewell is definitely the villain of the story, and his prejudice is racial. He accuses Tom of raping his daughter, and expects the rest of the town to follow along - which they do. Throughout his testimony in court, Bob Ewell is crass and dirty, saying things like “I seen that black nigger yonder ruttin’ on my Mayella!” He is the lowest person in Maycomb, financially, socially, and ethically. However, the case’s jury still ends up trusting his word more than that of Tom Robinson, a respectable black man. This shows the prejudice of the entire town of Maycomb, and how its residents would rather see a black person wrongfully convicted than have a white person proven a liar. Bob Ewell is essentially the personification of this element of Maycomb.

  <div id="prejudice" class="imdo"><div class="caption"><span class="charCaption"></span></div></div>
  <div class="depthText"><h1>Prejudice</h1><p>Prejudice is a key player in <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, and remains as such in the present day. I think that it is important that we learn to recognize prejudice in our everyday lives, and try to remove it. This is one of the reasons why <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> is so important - it teaches us to identify prejudice in the characters of Maycomb county, making it easier to find it in our daily lives. All of the characters I discussed today demonstrate different types of prejudice, whether they be racial, social, or gender-based. An example of people not seeing prejudice in front of their own noses is at the end of the book, when Scout’s teacher Miss Gates teaches the class about Jewish people: “The Jews have been persecuted since the beginning of history, even driven out of their own country. It’s one of the most terrible stories in history.” Miss Gates and the children can easily recognize that this is wrong, and yet cannot see the prejudice that they have against people of color. The amount of prejudice in this modern world can seem overwhelming, but it can be helpful to remember that most of the characters in <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> with prejudices all have good sides too, and can change their minds. And the same goes for us: we all have prejudices, but we can find our good side and change our minds too.
